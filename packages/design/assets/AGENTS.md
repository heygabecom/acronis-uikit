# AGENTS.md — `packages/design/assets`

`@acronis-platform/assets` — a **published** data-only workspace:
DTCG-divergent JSON manifests for icons and illustrations, plus the
bundled icon/illustration binaries they point at. No components, no
build, no runtime API — it ships data.

The package borrows DTCG `$`-prefix vocabulary but is **NOT**
DTCG-conformant: project fields live at top-level keys (`values`,
`platforms`, `metadata`), not inside `$extensions.com.acronis.*`.

Repo-wide rules (TypeScript, file naming, Conventional Commits,
Changesets) live in the repo root's [`../../../context/`](../../../context/)
and apply on top. This file documents only what is specific to this
workspace; the deeper conceptual reference lives in
[`./context/`](./context/).

## Validate

This is the only script that does real work. From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm --filter @acronis-platform/assets test       # alias for validate
pnpm --filter @acronis-platform/assets validate    # ajv-compiles both schemas, validates packs/*.json and rules/*.json
```

`build` / `dev` / `clean` / `lint` / `typecheck` are intentional no-ops
— there is nothing to compile in a JSON data package. `test` runs the
ajv validation so `pnpm -r test` covers this workspace in CI.

## Authoritative specs

- [`context/spec.md`](./context/spec.md) — the normative contract: DTCG divergence,
  `$`-prefix discipline, the cases a manifest MUST cover (R1–R16), invariants, and the
  resolution algorithm (how a renderer reads a manifest; NOT rule execution).

`spec.md` is the source of truth for format and runtime behavior; the other
`context/*.md` docs below explain the concepts behind it.

## Loading context

This index is **not a knowledge base**. Before any non-trivial work, find
the matching row below and **read every listed file in full** before acting.
Do not load files that aren't listed; do not skip files that are. When a new
file lands under `./context/`, add a row here in the same change — an unlisted
file is invisible to the agent.

## Third-party content & licensing

Some icons are derived from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) (ISC). The
package as a whole is MIT, but the Lucide ISC notice **must** be retained
— see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE), `THIRD-PARTY CONTENT` section. When you add
assets derived from a new third-party source, append its attribution +
full license text there (see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Changesets

This is a **published** workspace, so a change to its published surface
(`packs/`, `rules/`, `schemas/`, the `exports` map) needs a changeset.
See [`../../../context/releasing.md`](../../../context/releasing.md).

## Conventions for new context files

- `context/<name>.md`, lowercase-hyphen-separated, one concept per file. Do not
  duplicate content across files; cross-link with relative paths.
- Never inline rules into this file — extract to a file under `context/`
  and add a table row in the same change.
