# Manifest

The shape of a Pack manifest at `../packs/<pack-id>.json`, end to end: the pack root, the flat assets map, each asset's per-variant `values`, its `metadata`, and its `platforms` scope. The runtime algorithm that reads a manifest into concrete `(asset, variant) → binary` outputs lives in [`spec.md`](./spec.md).

## Pack manifest

### Required top-level keys

| Key       | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$schema` | REQUIRED | MUST be `"../schemas/pack.schema.json"`.                                                                                              |
| `name`    | REQUIRED | Pack id. MUST equal the filename stem (e.g., `icons-stroke-mono.json` → `"icons-stroke-mono"`). Pattern: `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`.         |
| `version` | REQUIRED | Semver. New manifests start at `"1.0.0"`.                                                                                             |
| `$type`   | REQUIRED | `"vector"` or `"raster"`. Inherits to every Asset unless an Asset overrides it. See [`spec.md`](./spec.md).                           |
| `values`  | REQUIRED | Pack-level Variant map. Carries the canonical marker and any shared Variant computations. See [Variants & values](#variants--values). |
| `assets`  | REQUIRED | Flat map of Asset id → Asset. See below.                                                                                              |

Anything else at the root fails schema validation.

### `assets` is flat

Asset entries sit directly under `assets`. NO grouping by category, NO tier hierarchy. Rationale: category is a _query_ on metadata, not a structural property; structure SHOULD have exactly one place to look up an Asset by id.

```json
{
  "assets": {
    "add":    { "values": { ... }, "platforms": [...], "metadata": { ... } },
    "remove": { "values": { ... }, "platforms": [...], "metadata": { ... } },
    "edit":   { "values": { ... }, "platforms": [...], "metadata": { ... } }
  }
}
```

### Asset id rules

- Pattern: `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` — lowercase, kebab-case, starts with a letter. (The `illustrations` pack opts into a digit-prefixed variant for its 4-digit catalog ids — see [`packs.md`](./packs.md).)
- **Bare names** — `add`, `remove`, `edit`. NOT `icon-add` — the Pack name carries the icon context.
- **Unique within a Pack only.** Same id MAY appear in multiple Packs (e.g., `add` in both `icons-stroke-mono` and `icons-solid-mono`). External consumers address an Asset as `<pack>.<id>`.

### Empty stubs

A Pack with `"assets": {}` validates — useful for stubbing a new Pack before authoring any Asset. None of today's 5 Packs are empty. Note that `values` is still REQUIRED even on an empty stub: it MUST be present and carry at least the canonical marker (one entry flagged `"default": true`).

### Forbidden at the manifest root

- Any key not in the table above.
- Inline category groupings: `{ "assets": { "actions": { "add": {...} } } }` — wrong; category lives in [`metadata`](#metadata).
- A `$type` of `"asset"`, `"asset-vector"`, `"icon"`, etc.

## Asset shape

The smallest legal Asset: one source variant, `platforms`, and the three required `metadata` arrays.

```json
"add": {
  "values": {
    "24": { "$file": "./packs/icons-stroke-mono/add-24.svg" }
  },
  "platforms": ["PD"],
  "metadata": {
    "category": [],
    "tags": [],
    "legacyNames": []
  }
}
```

### Top-level keys

| Key            | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$type`        | optional | Override the inherited Pack-level `$type`. Same enum: `"vector"` or `"raster"`.                                                                                                                                          |
| `$description` | optional | One-line human-readable summary. NOT a metadata replacement — search lives in `tags`.                                                                                                                                    |
| `values`       | REQUIRED | Variant map for this Asset. At minimum supplies the canonical's `$file` — the Pack's `values` only carries shared computed (or source) siblings, never the per-asset binary. See [Variants & values](#variants--values). |
| `platforms`    | REQUIRED | `("WEB" \| "PD")[]`, `minItems: 1`. Per-asset only; NOT defaultable. See [Platform scope](#platform-scope).                                                                                                              |
| `metadata`     | REQUIRED | `{ category, tags, legacyNames }`. Per-asset only; NOT defaultable. See [Metadata](#metadata).                                                                                                                           |
| `$extensions`  | optional | Narrow escape hatch reserved for Figma round-trip metadata. `^com\.figma\.` keys only. See [`spec.md`](./spec.md).                                                                                                       |

Anything else fails schema validation.

### Forbidden

- A top-level `$value` on the asset (DTCG-style). Values live in `values`.
- A `$type` of `"asset"`, `"icon"`, `"illustration"`, `"mixed"`.
- A `com.acronis.*` key inside `$extensions` — the project does NOT use that namespace in assets anymore. See [`spec.md`](./spec.md).
- Asset-level overrides of metadata fields per variant. Metadata is per-asset, not per-variant.

## Variants & values

`values` is an object map keyed by variant id, on both the pack root and each Asset. Variant ids match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`. Today every variant key is a numeric-string size:

- `"16"`, `"20"`, `"24"`, `"32"`, `"48"`, `"64"`, `"96"` — and any other positive integer.

No floats, no units. A variant key is NOT a pixel measurement stamped on the file — it's a stable identifier for the variant. The schema also admits non-numeric ids (`"dark"`, `"24-dark"`, `"de-DE"`) so theme / locale / composite dimensions can arrive later without restructuring.

Each entry is one of:

### Source — `$file`

```json
"24": { "$file": "./packs/icons-stroke-mono/add-24.svg" }
```

- `$file` is project-relative and MUST match `^\.\/packs/[a-z0-9-]+/[a-z0-9-]+\.(svg|png|webp)$`.
- MUST resolve under [`../../assets/packs/<pack>/`](../../assets/packs/) at commit time.
- A source points at a binary; it is not computed from anything else.

### Computed — `$rules` (+ optional `$from`)

```json
"16": { "$rules": ["scale-16", "stroke-1-6"] }
```

- `$rules` is a non-empty array of rule ids declared under [`../../assets/rules/`](../../assets/rules/). See [`rules.md`](./rules.md).
- Rules apply **left to right** against the resolved source. The same rule MAY appear more than once, but reviewers SHOULD flag this — it usually indicates intent that belongs in a new rule.
- **`$from` is omitted in the common case** — the computation then runs against the asset's **effective canonical** (see below). Most pack-shared computations omit `$from`.
- Provide `$from: "<sibling-id>"` **only** to compute from a _non-canonical_ sibling on the same asset:

  ```json
  "192": { "$from": "96", "$rules": ["scale-192"] }
  ```

  `$from` is always a literal variant id looked up on the **same Asset**. Cross-asset and cross-pack references are forbidden by construction. (There is no `$base` field and no `{this.<size>}` alias — both are gone; the source of a computation is named structurally, implicitly the effective canonical or explicitly via `$from`.)

### Opt out — `null`

```json
"32": null
```

Setting a variant key to `null` in an asset's `values` removes that variant for the asset — it does not exist, even if the pack supplies it.

### The canonical — `"default": true`

Exactly one variant is the **canonical**: the source of truth other variants compute from, and the variant a translation tool preselects. It is marked inline by `"default": true` on a variant entry — never a string pointer, never a separate field.

- **Pack level** declares the canonical with a bare marker (no `$file`), because each asset supplies its own binary:

  ```json
  "24": { "default": true }
  ```

- **Asset level** supplies the binary for that variant. An asset that uses the pack canonical just provides the `$file` — it inherits the flag:

  ```json
  "24": { "$file": "./packs/icons-stroke-mono/add-24.svg" }
  ```

- An asset MAY **override** the pack canonical (R12) by flagging a _different_ entry. Then it carries both the path and the marker:

  ```json
  "32": { "$file": "./packs/icons-stroke-mono/special-32.svg", "default": true }
  ```

**Effective canonical** = the id flagged in `asset.values` if any, else the id flagged in `pack.values`. Because the flag lives _on_ a variant entry, the canonical always names a real entry — it cannot dangle. The canonical is always a source, never computed, never `null`.

### Pack-level `values` and the per-key merge

The pack root carries `values` directly (no `defaults` wrapper) — a variant map shared by every Asset that does not override per key, with the same value shapes as per-asset `values`. It holds the pack canonical marker plus any shared computed (or source) variants.

The effective `values` for an Asset is a shallow per-key merge, `{ ...pack.values, ...asset.values }`, where the asset wins:

- If the Asset declares key `X`, the Asset's entry wins **entirely** for `X`. There is NO deep-merge inside a variant value — you cannot, e.g., override only the `$rules` of an inherited computed value while keeping its `$from`.
- If the Asset declares key `X` as `null`, key `X` is **removed** (opt-out, R5) even though the pack supplies it.
- If the Asset does not declare key `X`, the pack value for `X` applies unchanged.
- An Asset MAY omit `values`… but it MUST still supply the `$file` source for the effective canonical, so in practice every Asset declares at least its canonical entry.

**Late binding.** A pack-level computation that omits `$from` binds to **each consuming asset's own effective canonical** at resolution time. A pack-level `"16": { "$rules": ["scale-16", "stroke-1-6"] }` means "for each Asset, compute its `16` from THAT asset's canonical." If an asset overrides the canonical (R12), the same shared `16` recomputes from the new canonical — no per-asset edit needed. This is how one pack `values` entry serves every asset.

A variant belongs in pack `values` when the _same_ value is shared by a strict majority of Assets in the Pack. Adding a shared value never costs an Asset — Assets with the same value drop the key; Assets with a different value keep theirs.

### What rules MUST NOT do

- Change the Asset's `$type`. A `vector` computation MUST yield a vector; a `raster` computation MUST yield a raster.
- Cross-asset effects. Rule input is a single source value; output replaces that variant only.

### Worked example — pack values plus three assets

This is the canonical reference (mirrors `../../assets/packs/concept-pack.json`).

```json
{
  "$schema": "../schemas/pack.schema.json",
  "name": "concept-pack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "$type": "vector",
  "values": {
    "24": { "default": true },
    "16": { "$rules": ["scale-16"] },
    "32": { "$rules": ["scale-32"] }
  },
  "assets": {
    "icon-basic": {
      "$description": "Plus glyph. Ships only the canonical 24px; 16 and 32 come from pack values.",
      "values": {
        "24": { "$file": "./packs/concept-pack/icon-basic-24.svg" }
      },
      "platforms": ["WEB", "PD"],
      "metadata": {
        "category": ["actions", "general"],
        "tags": ["plus", "create", "new", "insert"],
        "legacyNames": ["icon-plus", "plus-thin"]
      }
    },
    "icon-extended": {
      "$description": "Pencil glyph. Adds a 96 variant beyond pack values; 96 computes from the canonical (no $from).",
      "values": {
        "24": { "$file": "./packs/concept-pack/icon-extended-24.svg" },
        "96": { "$rules": ["scale-96"] }
      },
      "platforms": ["WEB", "PD"],
      "metadata": {
        "category": ["actions", "content"],
        "tags": ["pencil", "modify", "compose"],
        "legacyNames": ["icon-pencil", "edit-thin"]
      }
    },
    "icon-file-override": {
      "$description": "Minus glyph. 16px overrides the pack-computed variant with a hand-authored binary to preserve optical balance.",
      "values": {
        "24": { "$file": "./packs/concept-pack/icon-file-override-24.svg" },
        "16": { "$file": "./packs/concept-pack/icon-file-override-16.svg" }
      },
      "platforms": ["WEB"],
      "metadata": {
        "category": ["actions"],
        "tags": ["minus", "subtract"],
        "legacyNames": ["icon-minus"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

What each one demonstrates:

- **`icon-basic`** (R1 + R2) — the common case: declares only the canonical `24` file; `16` and `32` are inherited from the pack-level `values` and compute from this asset's canonical.
- **`icon-extended`** (R3) — extends with a _new_ `96` variant the pack does not define; it computes from the canonical because `$from` is omitted.
- **`icon-file-override`** (R6) — replaces the pack-computed `16` with a hand-authored file because scale-down rules cannot preserve optical balance for this glyph.

### Executor scope and runtime invariants

The manifest declares INTENT. The executor that reads a rule file and transforms an SVG is **out of scope today**; rule files under [`../../assets/rules/`](../../assets/rules/) describe semantics precisely enough that an executor can be implemented later — see [`rules.md`](./rules.md). Resolution (merging values, picking the canonical, emitting derivation plans) is specified in [`spec.md`](./spec.md), which also checks invariants the schema does NOT enforce:

- That `$file` paths actually exist on disk.
- That a `$from` sibling — or, when `$from` is omitted, the effective canonical — exists and is non-null in the merged values map.
- That the effective `values` for an Asset resolves a canonical to a `$file` source.
- That exactly one canonical (`"default": true`) is in effect after the pack/asset merge.
- That `$rules` ids resolve to files in [`../../assets/rules/`](../../assets/rules/).
- That derivation chains are acyclic.

## Metadata

Per-asset descriptive fields under the top-level `metadata` key. Per-asset only — no Pack-level inheritance, no per-Variant overrides, NOT defaultable. (`platforms` is a sibling of `metadata`, not a member of it — see [Platform scope](#platform-scope).)

```json
"metadata": {
  "category":    [...],
  "tags":        [...],
  "legacyNames": [...]
}
```

All three fields are REQUIRED on every Asset. Empty arrays are allowed.

| Field         | Type       | Notes                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `category`    | `string[]` | UI-grouping hints. Open vocabulary today (e.g., `"actions"`, `"navigation"`, `"content"`, `"dark"`, `"light"`). An Asset MAY belong to multiple categories. |
| `tags`        | `string[]` | Free-form search keywords. Lowercase, no punctuation beyond hyphens.                                                                                        |
| `legacyNames` | `string[]` | Historical names this Asset used to be known by. Useful when migrating consumers. Flat list today; no "still resolvable" vs "historical only" distinction.  |

### What metadata does NOT cover

- **Platform scope** — lives at the top-level `platforms` sibling. See [Platform scope](#platform-scope).
- **Visual semantics** — what the Asset _looks like_ belongs in `$description`.
- **Per-Variant information** — sizes are Variants; Variant-specific data belongs in [Variants & values](#variants--values).
- **Cross-asset relationships** — Assets do not reference other Assets today.

### Why metadata is not defaultable

Pack-level inheritance exists for `values` only (see [Pack-level `values`](#pack-level-values-and-the-per-key-merge)). `category`, `tags`, and `legacyNames` are inherently per-Asset — defaulting them risks silently-wrong values flowing into Assets that should have declared their own. Each Asset MUST author its own `metadata` object even when it is mostly empty arrays.

## Platform scope

> ⚠️ This enum is mirrored in `@acronis-platform/tokens`; the two MUST stay in sync — a
> change here requires the same change there.

Platform scope declares which consumers an asset targets so downstream tooling can route correctly. Stored at the top-level `platforms` key on each Asset, sibling to `values` and `metadata`:

```json
"add": {
  "values": { ... },
  "platforms": ["PD"],
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```

No pack-level inheritance, no defaultability, no per-mode override. Every Asset MUST declare `platforms`.

### Shape

`("WEB" | "PD")[]` — closed enum, `uniqueItems`, `minItems: 1`.

| Value | Meaning                                            |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `WEB` | Web product surface (apps, dashboards, marketing). |
| `PD`  | Product Design (internal design-system surface).   |

Order-insensitive. `["WEB", "PD"]` and `["PD", "WEB"]` are equivalent semantically; validators do not normalize.

### Default

`["PD"]`. Every asset starts here. Widen to `["WEB"]` or `["WEB", "PD"]` only when the asset has been audited for the additional consumer.

### Why it's a closed enum

Consumers branch on the value: a `WEB`-only asset is excluded from the Product Design package, and vice versa. A typo (`"WEEB"`, `"web"`) MUST fail at validation time, not silently route to the wrong consumer. Adding a third value (e.g. `"MOBILE"`) requires a coordinated schema change in both `assets/schemas/pack.schema.json` and the tokens schema, plus this file (and its tokens mirror).
